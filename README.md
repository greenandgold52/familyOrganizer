# familyOrganizer
To create a simple and easy access repository of information that Foster families can use to keep track of what is going on.

The base project will be free with ad support and a pro version(same app no ads) for any willing to donate to the app. Base project will be able to be used by any one trying to organize a family.

Additional features will be added to benefit foster familys such as licensing requirements, additional resources, ability to send updated information to case workers securely etc.

Final long term plan is to have a foster agency be able to keep track of its foster parents, make incident reports quick and easy, update and add chages to licensing themselves.

Three base rules for the project will be security, simplisity and accessability. Each childs information needs to be secure and the app needs to be used by the least tech savey person there is. There cannot be any finacial, eduational socital gap in the programming making it accessable for all.
